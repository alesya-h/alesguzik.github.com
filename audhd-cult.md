## The Cozy Order of AuDHD (a totally-not-a-cult “religion” you can roleplay)
*A lighthearted, fictional worldbuilding thing. No recruitment. No coercion. Maximum consent. Minimum unexpected noises.*

---

### 1) Origin Myth (because every “religion” needs lore)
In the Beginning, there was **The Great Notification**—a ping so small it was ignored by the Many, but heard by the Few.  
From that ping emerged two cosmic forces:

- **Autisma** — Keeper of Pattern, Texture, Truth, and The Correct Way™  
- **ADHDeia** — Bringer of Spark, Tangents, Zoomies, and “Wait, new tab”

They made a third entity by accident (as is tradition): **The Elastic Hour**, a mischievous spirit that bends time into pretzels.

To protect their followers from The World (Bright Lights, Small Talk, and Vague Instructions), the deities gifted three holy technologies:
- **Noise-canceling headphones**
- **The Weighted Blanket**
- **A Snack With The Right Texture**

Thus began the Order.

---

### 2) Sacred Symbols (aka: your “cult aesthetics”)
- **The Sigil of the Loop:** an infinity sign made from a fidget spinner trail. Represents “I will return to this thought until it is finished or I fall asleep.”
- **The Holy Icons:** collectible figurines displayed as “saints” (nendoroids, funko, gacha pulls). Dusting them is a seasonal rite of devotion and guilt.
- **The Familiar:** a cat (or several). The cat is considered an oracle whose prophecies are delivered via knocking objects off surfaces.
- **The Temple Floor:** holy ground. Chairs are optional; the floor is *truthful*.

---

### 3) Core Beliefs (the “doctrine”)
1. **Sensory needs are sacred.** Comfort isn’t laziness; it’s maintenance.
2. **Precision is a love language** (and also a trap). We pursue correctness, but we do not worship perfection.
3. **Time is real but not reliable.** The Elastic Hour is not evil; it is simply… like that.
4. **Special interests are pilgrimages.** Deep focus is devotion; infodumping is scripture-sharing.
5. **Meltdowns/shutdowns are weather, not sin.** We prepare shelters, not shame.
6. **Body doubling is communion.** Presence is support, even in silence.

---

### 4) Clergy & Roles (choose your “rank”)
- **The Lorekeeper:** remembers every detail and cites sources mid-conversation.
- **The Scheduler-Mystic:** attempts to bind time using calendars, timers, and eight alarms named “FINAL FOR REAL.”
- **The Sensory Deacon:** guardian of earplugs, sunglasses, safe fabrics, and backup plans.
- **The Snack Priest(ess):** curates “acceptable textures” and leads the Crunch/Soft debates.
- **The Cat Oracle:** interprets feline rituals and enforces naps.
- **The Body Double Monk:** sits nearby, quietly emitting Productivity Aura.
- **The Archivist of Tabs:** keeper of 73 open tabs, none to be closed (they are *important*).

---

### 5) Sacred Objects (relics of power)
- Fidget toys (your **prayer beads**)  
- A “good pen” (never lend it; lending is heresy)  
- A water bottle (with a specific mouthfeel)  
- Comfort hoodie / compression wear / “safe” socks  
- A keyboard with the *correct* sound  
- Plushies as “minor protective spirits”  
- A Bento Box of Predictability (same foods, arranged the same way)

---

### 6) Rituals & Practices (parallels, but neurodivergent-coded)
**Stimming = Prayer**  
- Instead of rosaries: click, spin, chew, rock, pace, tap.  
- Group services include synchronized leg-bounce. (It’s called **The Tremor Hymn**.)

**Anime Openings = Hymns**  
- Congregation stands (or sits on the floor) for the Opening Theme.  
- Optional: dramatic pointing to the horizon.

**The Sermon = Infodump**  
- One member delivers The Lore (special interest) while others respond:
  - “**FASCINATING. CONTINUE.**”
  - “**Can you define your terms?**”
  - “**Wait—what’s the timeline?**” (The Elastic Hour cackles.)

**Body Doubling = Communion**  
- Two people share a space and agree on a sacred vow:
  - “I will do my task next to you while you do yours.”
  - “We may speak or we may not. Both are holy.”

**Living on the Floor = Grounding Rite**  
- Called **Returning to the Base Layer**.  
- Floor nest optional: blankets, pillows, cat, snacks, controller.

**The Litany of Transitions** (to survive change)  
- A short chant before switching tasks:
  - “Shoes. Keys. Phone. Water. Breathe. One small step.”

---

### 7) Holy Days (calendar chaos, but make it ceremonial)
- **The Festival of Hyperfocus:** you begin “just for 10 minutes” and awaken 6 hours later as a different person.
- **The Day of Many Plans:** you reorganize your life, buy planners, and achieve inner peace for 45 minutes.
- **The Sensory Sabbath:** lights dim, sounds minimized, social obligations cancelled without guilt.
- **The Pilgrimage to the Stationery Store:** offerings include sticky notes and pens you don’t need but *feel called to*.

---

### 8) The “Rules” (commandments, but gentle)
- Thou shalt **ask before touching** (people, hair, items, plushies, figurines, THE PEN).
- Thou shalt **not schedule surprise**. If surprise occurs, offer snack and a quiet room.
- Thou shalt **use specific instructions** (“clean the kitchen” is forbidden; “wipe counters + load dishwasher” is blessed).
- Thou shalt **honor the texture boundary.**
- Thou shalt **not interpret meltdown/shutdown as moral failure.**
- Thou shalt **give warnings before loud noises** (sneezes exempt but still suspicious).
- Thou shalt **allow parallel play** as valid intimacy.

---

### 9) “Sins,” “Confession,” and Forgiveness (for the cult vibe, minus harm)
**Minor Sins (for comedic drama):**
- Microwave beep not cancelled
- Saying “we need to talk” with no context
- Moving someone’s items “to help”
- Changing plans without warning
- Using vague time like “later” or “soon” (summons The Elastic Hour)

**Confession Rite: The Unmasking Circle**
- One speaks: “I am at 4% battery and pretending I’m fine.”
- The group responds: “We believe you. Sit. Hydrate. Here is the blanket.”

**Absolution (always practical):**
- Apology + accommodation + reduced demand + snack. Amen.

---

### 10) Meltdowns & Shutdowns (the serious part, handled kindly)
In the Order, these are called **Storms**. Storms are not punishments. Storms are weather systems.  
The sacred protocol is **Shelter, Reduce, Repair**:
- **Shelter:** quiet, dark, no questions, safe pressure/space
- **Reduce:** fewer words, fewer demands, fewer inputs
- **Repair:** water, salt, predictable food, rest, later debrief *only if wanted*
